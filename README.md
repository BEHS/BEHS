I am a Research Scientist with the Earth System Science Center of the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), supporting the EarthRISE program led out of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center. Previously, I served as the Regional Science Coordination Lead for Central America for NASA’s longstanding SERVIR program. I previously served as a Research Scientist with the Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC). At CATHALAC, I worked on a number of projects, including the NASA-supported SERVIR-Mesoamerica program and the European Commission-funded PREVDA project, where I applied my remote sensing expertise in developing an updated map of Central America’s land cover. In 2008, I served as National GIS Coordinator for Guatemala’s National Protected Areas Council (CONAP), where I was responsible for a range of activities, from spatial analysis to modeling scenarios for projects in protected areas. My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science degree in agronomic engineering from the University of San Carlos in Guatemala, and a master’s degree in environmental management & auditing with a focus in renewable energy jointly from the University of San Pablo in Guatemala and UNINI in Puerto Rico. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Earth observation from the University of Twente in the Netherlands. My research interests include land cover assessment, spatial hydrology, and the use of Earth observation data for risk management.
