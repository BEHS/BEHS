I am a Research Scientist with the [Earth System Science Center (ESSC)](https://www.uah.edu/essc) of the [University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH)](https://www.uah.edu), supporting the [EarthRISE program](https://github.com/NASA-EarthRISE) led out of [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov)’s [Marshall Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/marshall/). Previously, I served as the Regional Science Coordination Lead for Central America for NASA’s longstanding SERVIR program. I previously served as a Research Scientist with the [Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC)](https://cathalac.int/). At CATHALAC, I worked on a number of projects, including the NASA-supported SERVIR-Mesoamerica program and the European Commission-funded PREVDA project, where I applied my remote sensing expertise in developing an [updated map of Central America’s land cover](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315711327_Mapa_Centroamericana_de_cobertura_y_uso_de_la_tierra_cambios_de_cobertura_y_uso_de_la_tierra_1980-1990-2000-2010). In 2008, I served as National GIS Coordinator for Guatemala’s [National Protected Areas Council (CONAP)](https://conap.gob.gt/), where I was responsible for a range of activities, from spatial analysis to modeling scenarios for projects in protected areas. My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science degree in agronomic engineering from the University of San Carlos in Guatemala, and a master’s degree in environmental management & auditing with a focus in renewable energy jointly from the University of San Pablo in Guatemala and UNINI in Puerto Rico. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Earth observation from the [Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation](https://www.itc.nl/) of the University of Twente in the Netherlands. My research interests include land cover assessment, spatial hydrology, and the use of Earth observation data for risk management.
